# coreBOSWebserviceJS â€” the AngularJS coreBOS Webservice API Browser

This project is a test bed which I use to learn and test [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) web app development based on the [coreBOS](http://corebos.org/) backend.

As data from a webservice I use [coreBOS WebService API](http://corebos.org/documentation/doku.php?id=en:devel:corebosws), so while I test and learn I am also constructing a way to access all that information from AngularJS for other similar projects.

Feel free to have a look and use as you may need and don't forget to come on over to [our website](http://corebos.org/) for full details of the project and follow us on [Google+](https://plus.google.com/communities/109845486286232591652) and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/groups/coreBOS-7479130?trk=my_groups-b-grp-v) for regular updates.
